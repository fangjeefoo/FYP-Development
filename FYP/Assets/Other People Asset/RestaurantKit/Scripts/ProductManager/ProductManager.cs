	public int totalIngredients;

	//In the inspector, use the number above "totalIngredients" as the lentgh of this array.
	//then assign proper ID of desired ingredients to array's childs.
	//note that IDs index should be carefully selected from existing ingrediets. in this kit we have 21 ingredients,
	//so we can choose any index from 0 to 20.
	//we also can use duplicate indexs. meaning a product can consist of two or more of the same ingredient.
	public int[] ingredientsIDs;
	//for example
	// a custom product definition is like this:
	/*
	totalIngredients = 6;
	ingredientsIDs[0] = 0;
	ingredientsIDs[1] = 4;
	ingredientsIDs[2] = 7;
	ingredientsIDs[3] = 12;

	//Another example
	/*
	totalIngredients = 3;
	ingredientsIDs[0] = 1;
	ingredientsIDs[1] = 2;
	ingredientsIDs[2] = 15;
